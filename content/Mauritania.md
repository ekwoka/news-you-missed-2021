In a country that’s 90% Sahara, with only one permanent river, water’s hard to come by.

Facing shortages and inconsistent supply, Mauritania recently launched a fundraising effort to secure $317 million for a project that will provide water to half a million in the south of the arid country.

Counting on several financiers from across the Arab world, the project will pipe water to urban and rural users in a bid to minimize the gap between the two and help to realize the region’s agricultural potential.
