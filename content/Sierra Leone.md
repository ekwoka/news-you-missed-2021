As the world warms, cities are getting hot, sometimes deadly hot.

This is the case in Freetown, the capital city of Sierra Leone.

In the face of deadly heat waves, the city has appointed an extreme heat official to draft a comprehensive heat strategy, raise general awareness, and create ways to protect the city's most exposed.

Freetown's exteme heat official is not just the first in Africa, but only the third such official in the world, joining those recently appointed in Miami and Athens.
