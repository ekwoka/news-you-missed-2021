Another unearthing took place in Mongolia, where archeologists were able to use a new technology to look below ground and map the ancient city of Karakorum, the capital of the Mongolian Empire established by Genghis Kahn in the 1200s.

Using magnetic fields to determine the footprintâ€™s layout and structural composition, the researchers determined, among other things, that the city was only at about 40% capacity, likely home to laborers and craftspeople, while the majority lived a more nomadic lifestyle.
