Last year the president of Turkmenistan erected a gilded statue of a beloved breed of dog, the Alabai.

This year, he took it a step further and announced a national holiday honoring the large, shepherd-like canine.

The paw-liday included a contest for the country’s best dog and a medal given to its top border guard dog.

Alabai now shares the special day with another of Turkmenistan’s celebrated: the Akhal-Teke horse breed.

Both are considered important parts of the national heritage, where herding is a traditional pastime.
