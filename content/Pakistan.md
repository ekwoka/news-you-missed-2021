How young is too young to charge someone with a crime? Pakistan faced down this very question when they charged an 8-year-old of blasphemy when the Hindu child peed in an Islamic school library.

In the incident’s wake, police charged the boy while, in reaction to the perceived disrespect, a mob vandalized a Hindu temple.

Eventually though, the state stepped in and punished the cops who arrested the child, dropped all charges, and organized payment for the temple’s repairs.
