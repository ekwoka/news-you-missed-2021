When it comes to finding fodder for Central Asian geopolitical cocktail talk, here’s a fun fact: Tajikistan’s primary export is migrant labor.

By September 2021, more than 1.6 million Tajiks left the country to work in Russia.

These migrant workers then send billions of dollars in remittances back home.

In 2019, actually, this figure accounted for more than one-quarter of Tajikistan’s GDP, making the ex-Soviet country still very dependent on Russia.
