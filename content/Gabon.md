Thereâ€™s some positive news about elephants coming out of Gabon, where new research shows the population of forest elephants, a cousin to the savanna-dwelling pachyderms, seem to be doing better than expected.

Previous estimates reported there were about 50,000 left in the Central African country, but a recent study shows that number to be closer to 95,000, thanks to strict anti-poaching regulations and land conservation measures.
