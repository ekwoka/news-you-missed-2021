In Argentina, a 30-year-old confirmed an age-old maxim: if it’s too good to be true, it usually is.

Searching for an explanation for a momentary Google outage, Nicolas Kuroña found that the domain google.com.ar had expired and that he could buy it for a modest $2.60.

The Argentine quickly scooped up the domain that, if everything broke his way, could be worth millions.

The domain didn’t prove a golden ticket though, but a mistake as Google’s ownership hadn’t lapsed, and in the end, Kuroña came out of the situation a few dollars lighter.
