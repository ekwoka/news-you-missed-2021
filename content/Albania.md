One European country has proved especially welcoming to Afghan refugees, and it’s one of the continent’s poorest.

Albania, bolstered by a culture familiar with and receptive to immigrants, pledged to take in as many as 4,000 Afghans.

The nearly 700 that made it to the coastal nation were put up in beach-side resorts.

Albania is likely just a year-long stop for refugees as they seek to secure visas to countries that offer more opportunity, but Albania has made it clear that they’re more than welcome to stay should they want to.
