From new findings, to expensive and rare findings, Petra Diamonds, the British producer of pink diamonds donned by the Queen herself, has settled to pay 4.

3 million pounds to 71 Tanzanian claimants who’ve accused the mining company of, among other things, beating, stabbing, and detaining them during their time as miners.

While the settlement makes “no admission of liability,” Petra has vowed to fund community projects and prevent future incidents.
