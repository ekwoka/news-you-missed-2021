Atmospheric conditions also made headlines in Bolivia, where UV radiation levels in La Paz hit 21, and that’s on a scale that typically tops out at 20.

The Bolivian capital sits at 11,800 feet, or 3,600 meters, above sea level, and low levels of clouds caused by climate change combined with a heat wave skyrocketed numbers on the UV index.

The World Health Organization calls an index of 11 “extreme," and 10 minutes exposed at these levels starts to burn the skin.

At 21, people just stay inside.
