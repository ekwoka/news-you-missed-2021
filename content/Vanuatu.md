Vanuatu is a remote Pacific island with just 300,000 residents.

So why did some 2,000 politicians, business owners, and criminals get citizenship there recently? Because for $130,000, they can.

The citizenship-by-investment program is legal, and gives these new residents visa-free access to the UK and European Union.

But, some worry the increased interest in this island, where the passport program accounted for nearly 42% of government revenue in 2020, might be fertile ground for money laundering and international mischief.
