An Arizona man who conducted a years-long human trafficking ring selling babies from the Marshall Island to American parents was sentenced to six years in prison and forced to pay hundreds of thousands in restitution charges.

The man would pay around $10,000 for pregnant Marshallese women to come to the United States and then arrange for their newborns to be adopted by couples for $40,000.

Officials estimate some 70 adoptions took place this way, taking advantage of the “compact of free association,” which allowed them to travel or move to the US without restriction.
