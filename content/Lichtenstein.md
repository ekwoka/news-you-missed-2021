Low government limitations have led to a hot streak of gambling development in Lichtenstein, one of the world’s smallest countries, now home to five casinos.

That may sound like a so-so number, but it puts its per capita above Monaco, Macau, and Las Vegas’ Clark County.

One reason? The gambling tax rate is lower than in neighboring countries, and the government there hasn’t set caps on the number of casinos that can be built.

Five more are in the pipeline, which means the foreign investors largely responsible for them are betting big on the future.
