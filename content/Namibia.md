In the early 1900s, Namibia was known as German South West Africa, and Germany is still dealing with its dark history there, which included troops that killed, tortured, and forced tens of thousands of native peoples into the desert to starve.

This year, then-Chancellor Angela Merkel reached a deal that will distribute $1.1 billion Euros over 30 years to benefit aid programs in the African country.

But, she stopped short of calling the funding “reparations,” and instead said it was “reconciliation” money that would help attempt to “heal the wounds” of the past.
