Currently, St. Lucia relies primarily on diesel generators for power, so any alternative that would alleviate high energy costs is welcomed, especially one as green as geothermal.

The next step is figuring out viability, a project that will be greatly aided by a $22 million grant made by the World Bank to explore the potential of the energy source.
