Have you heard of Grab or a SPAC? In this story, we have both.

Grab is a Singapore-based superapp that offers everything from ride sharing to banking in one tap.

SPAC is a special purpose acquisition company, an investment strategy in which a larger company merges with a publicly-traded shell company in order to expedite going public.

Grab signed a $39.5 billion merger deal with a US SPAC, which brought the company public on the NASDAQ stock exchange on December 2nd.

That makes it the largest-ever deal of its kind, and means we should pay attention to both SPACs and Grab ASAP.
