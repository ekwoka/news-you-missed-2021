Venturi, an innovative auto company and Formula E team from Monaco, announced its plan to launch its electric polar exploration vehicle in Antarctica.

While the world's been sending vehicles down there for decades, Venturi's will be the first that spews zero emissions as it transports scientists across the continent to conduct important climate-related research.

While it's been tested on French ski resorts, the sole focus has been getting the vehicle ready for the souther continent, a mission laid bare by the vehicle's name, "Antarctica."
