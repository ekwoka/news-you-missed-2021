Perhaps the world could’ve used a few more nosey onlookers in the Sea of Oman this year as noted not-friends Iran and the US offered wildly different accounts as to what really happened when Iran seized an oil tanker just off its coast.

Iran officials claimed that the US had taken their tanker before their successful naval assault reclaimed the ship, while US officials say that it was a Vietnamese tanker that Iran had seized.

Regardless of who’s telling the truth, this most recent rift offers a reminder of just how rocky the relations between the two nations remain.
