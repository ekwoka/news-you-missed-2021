Cuban officials wouldn’t be fooled twice this year.

After the largest protests in 30 years caught them off guard this July, the government made sure to stamp out the next protest before it even started.

As news spread of a potential pro-democracy, freedom of expression demonstration, the state didn’t let noted protesters leave their homes, arrested congregators, and released media claiming that protests were an attempt of regime change by the hands of the US.
