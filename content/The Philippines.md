Something that’s not going to last forever is Filipino President Rodrigo Duterte, who is constitutionally barred from seeking another six-year term.

Ahead of the May elections, those looking to replace him include a potpourri of people, including his daughter Sara Duterte; son and namesake of the country’s former dictator, Ferdinand “Bongbong” Marcos; former actor and Manila mayor Francisco Domagoso; and newly retired boxing star Manny Pacquiao.

With candidates expected to perform onstage with the public judging them on their singing and dancing abilities, the pool is certainly high on the entertainment factor.
