State overreach is the fear in Russia, as the Moscow metro has implemented a new method of payment at over 240 stations called Face Pay.

As the program’s name suggests, Moscow commuters can now leave their phone and wallet at home and simply smile for the camera to board the train.

In a country where governmental transparency is hard to come by and facial recognition has been allegedly used to identify protestors, Face Pay has human rights groups and dubious citizens concerned by the project’s potential ulterior motives.
