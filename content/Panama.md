Itâ€™s been a record-breaking year for Panama immigration officials as a whopping 70,000 migrants from around the world have passed through the Darien Gap and into the country.

Such incredible numbers making their way through the undeveloped, densely forested, and crime-riddled route with no formal roadways has pushed Panamanian and Colombian officials to begin regulating the number of entrants into the Darien Gap, potentially a first step in making the journey safer for the desperate migrants.
