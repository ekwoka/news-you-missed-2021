Fifty thousand dollars goes a long way.

In Liberia, $50,000 and doing the right thing with it will earn you a change to meet the president.

That was the case for Emmanual Tuloe, a teenage motorcycle taxi driver, who found a plastic bad on the side of the road stuffed with fifty grand in cash and returned it in full to the businesswoman who had lost it.

His good deed was praised by Liberians and earned him the chance to meet the president, with whom he wanted to discuss getting himself and fellow youngsters back in school.
