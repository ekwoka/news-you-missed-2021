Somalia got its first taste of the silver screen in 30 years, when the National Theatre of Somalia reopened for a screening featuing two short films by a homegrown director.

The theater, closed in 1991 at the start of the country's civil war, has been used frequently by warlords as their headquarters, and was then bombed by anti-entertainment jihadists.

Its reopening, though tenuous and under heavy security, marked a flicker of hope for the civilians, especially the movie-loving ones.
