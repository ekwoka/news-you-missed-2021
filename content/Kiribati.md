Another island nation concerned for its future is Kiribati, where six years ago, the government starred in its own version of “House Hunters” and purchased some 8.5 square miles, or 22 square kilometers, of land on Fiji to make sure its potentially displaced residents had somewhere to go as sea levels rise.

To use that land in the meantime, Kiribati enlisted the help of omnipresent China to build farms that would provide fresh produce and meat to the island nation, which currently imports all of its food.

Some say this is another land grab by China, while others see it as a sustainability measure for Kiribati.

Both of these takes miss what might be the most interesting part of this story: an actual overseas climate refuge in the first place.
