If two’s a party and three’s a crowd, then India is taking note.

Some states, including the country’s most populous, Uttar Pradesh, which has 240 million people and would be the world’s fifth most populous country by itself, introduced a China-like two-child policy and sterilization measures to control population growth.

Though it still has to be adopted, the proposal would deny state benefits, subsidies, and jobs to anyone who has more than two children, and dangles the carrot of incentives for anyone who gets sterilized.

Twelve states have actually adopted similar measures, all in an effort to limit growth in a country that’s already the second most populous in the world.
