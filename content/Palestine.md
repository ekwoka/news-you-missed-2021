In not-so-sweet news, Ben &amp; Jerry’s announced it would stop selling its ice cream in occupied Palestinian territories, making a very public corporate statement against the Israeli settlements there, which are not recognized by international law.

Israeli officials called the decision a “capitulation to antisemitism.”

The brand, however, will still be available throughout the internationally recognized territory of Israel, which sort of makes this ban “half-baked.”
