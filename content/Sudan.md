Sudan’s progress toward democratic rule hit a major speed bump this October when the military seized power.

Since the ousting of Omar al-Bashir in 2019, Sudan had been trending in the democratic direction––that was, until this most recent coup.

In response to the backslide, thousands of protestors hit the streets in Khartoum, while the US suspended a $700 million aid package meant to aid in the transition towards civilian governance.

The story is still developing though, as the US and UN are pressuring the military to release imprisoned politicians and return a civilian-government to power.
