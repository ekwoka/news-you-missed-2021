Another milestone was reached this year when Joe Biden became the first US President to acknowledge that the Armenian Genocide was in fact a genocide.

In Armenia, and across the Armenian diaspora, the news was welcomed with a tepid response not because of the 106 years of separation from the event, but because the declaration is, of course, merely a declaration.

Many see the statement as a symbolic gesture designed to test the relationship with Turkey who has yet to qualify the historical atrocity as a genocide.
