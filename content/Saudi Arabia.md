From sport cities to sports washing, it was a big year for professional athletics in Saudi Arabia.

After its high-profile, highly controversial takeover of Newcastle United, the country also announced a partnership between Golf Saudi and the Asian Tour that’ll keep a Saudi stop on Asia’s preeminent golf circuit and provide prize funding for a decade to come.

While a quieter development than the Newcastle deal, many denounced the move as another attempt to move conversation and attention away from the country’s human rights record with glitz and games.
