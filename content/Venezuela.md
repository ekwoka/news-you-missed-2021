Venezuelans have been fleeing their country in one of the world’s largest human migrations, and one-third of them head to neighboring Colombia.

Recently, Colombia announced its decision to provide temporary legal status to more than 1.7 million migrants who had fled there in recent years.

That means the migrants can work legally for up to 10 years.

A collapsed economy has created a humanitarian crisis, and refugees in search of a better life may find that with Colombia’s legal acceptance of them.
