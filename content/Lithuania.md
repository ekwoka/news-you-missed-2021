Conspiratorial might seem like a good way to describe Lithuania’s defense ministry calling for citizens to throw their Chinese-made cell phones away.

The request, though, comes after the nation’s cyber security center found that the Xiaomi Corp, a Chinese phone-maker, have censor technology built into devices that track 449 terms including the likes of “free Tibet,” and “democracy movement.”

The finding comes as relationships between China and Lithuania sour over Taiwan.
