2021 marked the end of the Free Latifa campaign, as the movement hatched three years ago finally saw its vision come to fruition.

Princess Latifa was captured by her father, Dubai’s Sheikh Mohammed bin Rashid al-Maktoum, when trying to express a little self-determination and leave the United Arab Emirates.

She had hardly been seen in the past three years but it seems her confinement came to an abrupt end as an Instagram photo showed the princess traveling in Iceland and a verifiable statement quoted her saying she could now “travel where I want.”
