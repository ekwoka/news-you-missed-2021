In the mountainous eastern European country, construction crews put the finishing touches on a state-of-the-art highway that cuts through rugged Montenegro.

Rather than celebrating though, residents are beginning to ask questions about the road’s $1 billion price tag, the road only connects a few small communities including the town at its terminus, Matesevo, home to a population of 15.

An early Belt and Road project built by Chinese crews, Montenegro’s finances are now seriously strained by the road that really doesn’t serve much of a purpose.
