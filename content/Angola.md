Downstream effects from an Angolan diamond mine were catastrophically felt in a toxic spill that sickened more than 1 million people, killed 12, and decimated fish and wildlife.

Waste from the largest diamond mine in Angola leaked into the Kasai River, which eventually reached the Congo river, where large amounts of heavy metal were detected.

The mine, which is partially owned by a Russian company, acknowledged there had been a leak, but said that it was just sand and mud, and of course, they claimed no responsibility for the disaster.
