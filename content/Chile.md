The worldâ€™s largest mammal, the blue whale, only feeds in a few specific regions, one of which is off the coast of Chilean Patagonia.

Unfortunately for the endangered species, the water is also teeming with fishing vessels working the busy salmon farming industry, with up to 1,000 boats a day passing through the feeding grounds.

This traffic has led to a handful of fatal collisions between boat and blue whale.

With the regional population estimated to be only in the hundreds, conservationists are scrambling to figure out a compromise that gives the whales a bit more room.
