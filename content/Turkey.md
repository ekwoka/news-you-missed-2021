Following the appearance of mysterious metallic monoliths across the American West and in Romania, a similar structure appeared in southwest Turkey.

But this one came with a message in ancient Turkish: “look at the sky, and you will see the moon.”

Residents didn’t have to wait long on an explanation as to the origins of the structure and its innocuous truism though, as only days after its discovery, President Erdoğan used the monolith as a background when he announced the country’s new space program and 10-year vision, proving the monolith’s function as an eye-rolling gimmick.
