A Solomon Islands man digging in his backyard to install a septic system struck something hard, but this was the opposite of treasure.

Instead, he discovered more than 100 unexploded World War II bombs, which came as a real surprise and a tragic reminder of the devastation the Pacific Islands suffered during that era, when thousands of bombs were dropped and munitions stores, like this one, were common.

The ordinances were successfully, and thankfully, removed by a specialized team.
