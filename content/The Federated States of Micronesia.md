title: The Federated States of Micronesia

Pacific Islander Nicole Yamase became the first citizen from The Federated States of Micronesia to reach Challenger Deep––the deepest part of the Mariana Trench, which lies within the territorial waters of the country.

Her completion of the 10-hour journey, which took her to 36,000 feet, or 11,000 meters, below the ocean’s surface, also makes her only the third woman, and at 29, the second-youngest, to ever do it.

She's a PhD student studying climate change’s effects on microalgae, and going to the world’s most remote places for research is all in a days’ work for her.
