The government in Slovenia is running an alleged crusade against culture, with Prime Minister Janez Jansa replacing the heads of several arts organizations in what some are calling a shift to more conservative approaches.

Jansa, who had served twice in the role prior to being ousted for corruption, named new leaders for the National Museum, the Museum of Contemporary History, and the Moderna Galerija, and he continues to terminate leases from arts organizations that rent space from the government.

He denies that it’s an orchestrated movement, but for many, it’s hard to paint over the facts.
