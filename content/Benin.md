In Benin, a law passed that drastically expands access to abortion and largely puts the decision in women’s hands.

What used to be legal only in cases of life-threatening pregnancies, rape, and incestuous relationships, is now allowed on account of a wide range of reasons within the first 12 weeks of pregnancy.

Globally, this move has been hailed by women’s rights activists, and regionally, this makes Benin the most progressive country on the issue in West Africa.
