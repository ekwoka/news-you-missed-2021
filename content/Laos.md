A plot to smuggle 55 million methamphetamine tablets and more than 1.5 tons of crystal meth disguised in beer crates was thwarted by police in Laos, resulting in the largest single drug seizure in Asia.

They were discovered in a truck in an area called the “Golden Triangle”––the meeting point of Myanmar, Laos, and Thailand, which is notorious as a hotspot for drug production and smuggling.

With recent unrest in Myanmar’s Shan region and Chinese crackdown on the trade, smugglers have looked to alternative routes––in this case, without much success.
