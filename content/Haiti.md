Democracy is in trouble in Haiti.

After a deadly earthquake, a presidential assasination, and bout after bout of gang violence, chaos and uncertainty are primed to carry into 2022 as general elections have been postponed for the fourth time.

This postponement comes after the prime minister decided to dissolve the council responsible for organizing elections.

The PM has said he plans on naming a new council, but has not committed to a timeline––a move that leaves the spiraling state, well, spiraling.
