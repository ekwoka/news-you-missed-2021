The stores of two priminent headline-makers collided this year when Tedros Adhanom, director-general of the World Health Organization, spoke on the first situation in north Ethiopia.

In November, the director-general said that the Tigray region of Ethiopia was under a "systematic blockade" and that people were dying because of the lack of supplies.

He also noted that Tigrayans were beign arrested en masse.

From Tigray himself, Adhanom never directly assigned blame as he's worked diligently to maintain a neutral position on the civil war that has consumed his home country.
