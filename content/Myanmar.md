There’s no accountability in this story, but there is a bit of good news from a country that’s increasingly cracking down on the freedom of the press: Myanmar released American journalist Danny Fenster from prison just days after he was sentenced to 11 years for charges that included incitement of violence and visa violations.

The military in Myanmar has clamped down on the media since seizing power in February, stripping publications of their licenses and banning outlets from broadcasting.

Fenster, however, was the first foreign journalist to be convicted for charges he says were without warrant, and thanks to negotiations by a former US ambassador to the UN, now he’ll go free.
