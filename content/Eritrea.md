Over 300 Eritreans born during Italy's rule have demanded Italian citizenship.

In the seven-off decades since colonial rule, Eritrean claims to Italian citizenship based on paternal bloodlines have fallen on deaf ears.

Racial rules during the fascist period, current Italian immigration policy, lack of documentation, and limited mobility under Eritrea's dictatorial rule have kept an estimated thousands of Eritreans from accessing Italian citizenship.

The latest push for recognition, though, shows these claims aren't fading quietly.
