Native baby sea turtle numbers on the 10-island nation of Cape Verde are booming, in a rabbit-like way.

The good news is that nest numbers last year were up to 200,000, which is 20 times the estimates from 2015.

The bad news is that sea turtlesâ€™ gender is determined by the temperature of the sand where the eggs are laid, and, well, the globally-warmed beach means that about 84% of baby sea turtles hatchlings are now female, which unfortunately still keeps the species on the endangered list.
