Researchers have found that elephants have behung ditching their tusks in the name of survival.

Once rare, tuskless Africa elephants have become increasingly common of the last 50 years, largely on account of poachers.

With 90% of the country's elephants killed for the ivory during Mozambique's civil war, tuskless elephants benefitted from an increased opportunity to pass down their tuskless genes.

With paching down and conservation up in recent decades, though, it's expected that tusks will come back in vogue.
