Garment workers in Bangladesh are more protected after an agreement was signed by some 200 international fashion companies that includes legally binding safety commitments, independent inspections at the factories, and contributions for safety training and factory improvements.

The accord replaces one that was created after a devastating factory fire that killed 1,100 people in 2013 and was set to expire.

Human rights workers praised the move, which means protections will continue into the future, and keep Bangladesh as one of the top garment producers in the world.
