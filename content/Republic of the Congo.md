Break out those dancing shoes, because the rumba may officially be a part of worldwide intangible cultural heritage.

The Republic of the Congo and the Democratic Republic of the Congo applied to UNESCO for the official designation, which would protect the dance’s history and cement its importance.

The rumba was born in 19th-century Cuba, combining the drumming of enslaved Africans with the melodies of Spanish colonizers.

But it’s not just of historical importance, because the rumba has modern-day relevance too, including the 1960’s “Independence Cha Cha,” a version of the rumba that celebrated the freedom of Belgian Congo.
