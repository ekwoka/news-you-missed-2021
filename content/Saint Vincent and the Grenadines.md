title: Saint Vincent and the Grenadines
---
Back underground we go, this time to Petite Mustique, which is part of Saint Vincent and the Grenadines, where a human skull was unearthed on this remote, rugged island in 2003.

And, this year, researchers at the University of Oregon may have uncovered why it was there: Skeletal abnormalities show the female likely had leprosy, and this isolated part of the Caribbean was probably used to keep people with the disease away from the public, something that many have speculated but this finding actually supports.

The skull dates back 200 years and is possibly the earliest case of leprosy recorded in the Americas.
