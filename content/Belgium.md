Expansion is something that a Belgian farmer accidentally did when he moved a several-hundred pound stone seven feet into France.

The historic markers delineate the borders between the two countries, and a team of Frenchmen who patrol the remote countryside verifying the positions noticed the errant stone.

Luckily, the farmer wasnâ€™t charged with violating the international treaty that certifies the border, a crime that could have resulted in a territorial war instead of a slap on the wrist.
