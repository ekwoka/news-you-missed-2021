In Rwanda, the crackdown on dissidents under President Paul Kagameâ€™s government has extended to YouTube creators.

Dieudonne Niyonsenga, whose channel, Ishema TV covers topics such as human rights abuses and has over 15 million views, was sentenced to seven years in prison after being found guilty of forgery, humiliation of state officials, and two other charges.

He was the second Rwandan YouTube critic to be arrested in a country where freedom of expression is becoming increasingly costly.
