One of Europe’s wealthiest people and the Czech Republic’s richest man, Peter Kellner, was tragically killed in a helicopter crash while heli-skiing in Alaska, along with four additional passengers.

Kellner was estimated to be worth $17.5 billion, and his death follows a string of recent fatal high-profile helicopter accidents including Kobe Bryant and French billionaire Olivier Dassault.
