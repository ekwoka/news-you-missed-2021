Polish researchers discovered a first: an Egyptian mummy with child.

Originally they thought the mummy mommy was a male priest, but further investigation uncovered a small femur bone thought to belong to a fetus about 25 to 30 weeks old.

Scientists called the find unique, and important to Egyptology, in which little research has been done on females.
