Islands in the Caribbean continue to bet big on tourism, especially countries like Dominica which offers Citizenship-by-Investment through properties like the six-star resort of Secret Bay.

For the fifth year in a row, Dominica was named the Best Country for Second Citizenship by Professional Wealth Management magazine.

The second-home citizens have primarily come from Africa, but with a new nonstop flight from Miami running, that could potentially change with Americans starting to look south for another home, and passport.

Added bonus: Dominican residents now get visa-free access to China.
