A finding in the remains of a different sort of nomad in Latvia cast doubt on previous theories as to the dramatic decline of stone-age peoples across western Europe 5,000 years ago.

DNA analysis of a hunter-gatherer showed the man died of the plague, making him the earliest victim of what was thought to have caused the mysterious population decline.

Analysis, however, also showed that the strain he carried didnâ€™t spread easily and caused milder symptoms than iterations that would follow.

Now, rather than plague, scientists are looking at climate change as a catalyst.
