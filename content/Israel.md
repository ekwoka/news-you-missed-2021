Spying seems to be a trend, but the United States told Israel they don’t want to play that game.

Israeli spyware maker NSO Group was placed on an American blacklist after it was reasonably confirmed that NSO’s signature product, Pegasus, was used by foreign governments against dissidents, journalists, diplomats, and clergy members.

The blacklisting means, among other things, that NSO won’t be able to buy components from US companies for its products, something Apple is ensuring after suing the group this year as well.
