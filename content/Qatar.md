In a country thatâ€™s been in the headlines for all the wrong reasons the past few years has emerged a more positive story.

The partnership will build two campuses, one in each country; create an estimated 1,000 jobs; and hopefully provide the resources and facilities for sustainability-oriented startups to take off.
