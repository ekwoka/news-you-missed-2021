Grenada announced the completion of a renovation to its underwater sculpture park.

Repairs and cleaning of already existing sculptures were part of the project, but the most exciting bit was the new 82-piece installation celebrating Grenadian culture.

Since its creation in 2006, the park has offered habitat for marine wildlife and served as an important tourist draw, the renovation aims to maintain that positive momentum.
