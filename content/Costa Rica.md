Costa Rica earned some well-deserved national attention when the country was named one of the five winners of the Earthshot Prize, a global sustainability effort spearheaded by Prince William and Kate Middleton.

Financed largely by taxes on fossil fuels, Costa Rica has handed more than $500 million to landowners over the last 20 years to protect forests and watersheds.

The effort has largely reversed deforestation in the country.

While the prize money is nice, the international recognition serves as a proof of concept for other nations and a pat on the back for forward-thinking Costa Rica.
