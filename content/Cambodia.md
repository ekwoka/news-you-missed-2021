Sometimes governmental overreach isnâ€™t unpleasant, as is the case with a defanged and declawed lion named Hima.

He was reunited with his owner after the Cambodian prime minister got involved.

Initially, Hima was seized after TikTok videos of him living casually in a high-end Phnom Penh neighborhood, something the government deemed inappropriate, went viral.

But additional posts showed a clear bond between the two after their separation, and following public calls for reunification, the prime minister announced the two would be rejoined.
