In Libya, there’s some frightening news on the artificial intelligence front.

A report commissioned by the United Nations found that a military drone strike used in the country’s civil war may have been carried out autonomously.

Allegedly, militia fighters were hunted down and attacked by a “weapons system” that did not require data connectivity.

Though it’s implied, the report doesn’t go as far as to say the drone acted autonomously.

Vagueness here is de rigueur, as the report also doesn’t say whether anyone was injured or killed.
