Disney+ finally launched in Hong Kong in 2021 and while much of the streaming service’s content provides a needed escape from the chaos and confusion that’s embroiled the Chinese territory in the past few years, one omission from the Simpson’s catalog hints at just how inescapable the tension has become.
