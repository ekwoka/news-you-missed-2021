Something else that’s stopping is the Parana River.

South America’s second-largest river straddles Paraguay, Argentina, and Brazil, and sadly, it’s the lowest it’s been in more than 70 years.

Scientists say deforestation in the Amazon is to blame, as rainfall, much of which emanates from the forest itself, has significantly decreased.

As a result, the river is 10.5 feet or 3 meters lower than normal, and threatening the lives and businesses of people who populate more than 60 towns along its shores.
