A substantial legal ruling was recorded this year in Malaysia as the country’s highest court ruled that the Islamic provision that banned same sex acts was unconstitutional.

LGBTQ advocates have called the ruling “historic” as the country’s experienced an uptick in homophobic sentiment in recent years.

This ruling though, does not legalize same-sex acts, as a civil law from Britain’s colonial-era banning those is still on the books.
