It’s banned for poachers to remove succulents from the desert in South Africa, but that hasn’t stopped it from being an explosive problem in a country that’s home to one-third of the world’s succulent species.

Specifically, people are harvesting Conophytum, which is a genus of flowering plants that consists of over 100 species, many of which are on the endangered list.

They’re then sold to hot markets including Korea and China, where the plants that were once considered low-class have become popular for being low-maintenance.
