When an immigrant commits a crime in the United Kingdom, they get deported, often by airplane.

Lately, however, the loads have been light with just four people sent back to Jamaica on a recent 350-passenger Airbus A350-900 flight.

That evens out to about $66,000, or 50,000 pounds, per person.

These costs have people wondering about the viability of such an expensive program, while others say itâ€™s critical to get convicted criminals out of the country.
