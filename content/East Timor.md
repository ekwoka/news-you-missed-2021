At sea level, impoverished East Timor is at an interesting economic crossroads, exploring eco-tourism, offshore drilling, and now, carbon capture storage as a way to boost the country’s revenue.

Australia has proposed capturing its own carbon waste and paying to store it in East Timor’s nearly depleted Bayu-Undan oil field, which is expected to run out in the next couple of years.

Proponents see this as a creative environmental solution, and critics say it’s simply shifting climate change responsibility from a rich country to a poor one.
