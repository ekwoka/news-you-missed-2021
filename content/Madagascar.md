Chameleons, by their very nature, are hard to spot.

A chameleon measuring just 29 millimeters from tip to tail, nearly impossible.

And yet, a group of scientists in northern Madagascar discovered a pair of these nano-chameleons who are now in the record books as the smallest of the planetâ€™s 11,500 reptiles.

Like so much in Madagascar, though, the future of the little lizard is up in the air as habitat loss has conservationists scrambling to protect the new finding.
