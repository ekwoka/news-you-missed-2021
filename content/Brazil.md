Birds are adapting to changing material living conditions.

A study of 77 non-migratory birds undertaken in Brazil has shown that each species has become smaller in stature over the past 40 years.

This finding in species confined to remote areas of the Amazon has allowed researchers to conclude that the shrinking is in response to the one major alteration in their environment: temperature rise.

While researches haven’t come to a consensus, it’s hypothesized that the birds are slimming down because they simply aren’t required to generate the same body heat as in decades prior––humans are doing it for them.
