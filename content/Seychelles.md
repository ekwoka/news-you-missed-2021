The Coco de Mer, a palm tree that produces the world’s largest, and subjectively, the most inappropriate, seed in the world, only exists in Seychelles.

In fact, the tree only grows on two of the archipelago’s 115 islands while the rare seed, sold mostly to bemused tourists, fetches up to $260.

Beloved by islanders, heavily regulated by the government, and yet still endangered, Seychelles is taking a new approach to conserving the tree by putting seeds in the hands of locals.

Those interested in growing the tree on their property can apply for the honor and must prove they have enough room and the right soil for the palm to take off.
