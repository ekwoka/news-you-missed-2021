Bucking tradition at the Tokyo Olympics, one sprinter, rather than running for her country, ran away from it.

Accusing her coaches of negligence before being pulled from her event and pressured to return home to Belarus, Krystsina Tsimanouskaya fled to the Polish embassy where she was granted a humanitarian visa.

The incident exemplifies the mounting pressure on Belarussian public figures under the countryâ€™s increasingly authoritarian government as she joins a growing list of athletes, coaches, and high-profile Belarussians that have faced job loss, arrest, or imprisonment when voicing discontent with the government in the past two years.
