Another agreement was reached in Spain, but this one pertains to many people’s go-to source for the day’s headlines: Google news.

Banned from the country for six years because Spain required Google to pay a central fee to media organizations for use of their stories, the new law now allows Google parent company, Alphabet, to negotiate directly with publishers for content.

Now, more than 1,000 Spanish media organizations can be sourced for news from a single smartphone.
