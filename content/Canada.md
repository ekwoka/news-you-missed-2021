This is a story about the good guy winning, but this time, itâ€™s a lobster.

A Canadian grocer noticed that no one was purchasing a certain carrot-colored crustacean, and on top of that, it was being picked on by other lobsters in the tank.

After several weeks he bought the lobster himself and donated it to the Toronto Aquarium, where it was discovered his strange hue was a one-in-30 million genetic mutation.

Pinchy, the lobster, avoided the plate and now has a more permanent, public home.
