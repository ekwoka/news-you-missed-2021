Finds that will happily be sent overseas include two of the world’s largest diamonds, unearthed this year in Botswana.

A 1,174-carat and 1,098-carat diamond were both discovered weeks apart in the country’s mines, which are some of the top-producing in the world.

Each diamond is about the size of someone’s hand, and they come at an important time for the market which is trying to rebound after the pandemic, bright news for the country and the soon-to-be betrothed.
