Nonuplets is the crossword-worthy term that reached household-level parlance across Mali in 2021.

Backed by nation-wide well-wishes, 25-year-old Halima Cissé was sent to a specialist in Morocco in late March to deliver seven babies, or so she thought.

To her doctor's surprise, Cissé harbored nine, all of which we born in good health.

Cissé's nonuplets now mark the record for the most babies born at once.
