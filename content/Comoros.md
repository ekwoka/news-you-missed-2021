It’s been a momentous year for sports fans on the island of Comoros, as the nation of under a million was ground zero for a history-making run by the national soccer team.

Minnows on the continental level, Comoros held World Cup qualifiers Egypt to a draw and went unbeaten during the African Cup League of Nations qualifying stage, a Cinderella run that will see the nation make the cup tournament for the first time.

Not bad for a team that didn’t even exist until 2006.
