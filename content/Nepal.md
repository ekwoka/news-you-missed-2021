Nepal counts how many people reach the top of Mount Everest.

Now, they’re unhappy with three Indian climbers who allegedly falsified their summit of the world’s highest peak in 2016.

This year, the Nepalese government penalized them by banning them for six years, essentially preventing them from actually trying to get to the top another time.

The Nepalese ministry verifies climbs through photographic evidence, and while these three had the photos, presumably photoshopped, they reportedly didn’t have enough oxygen to have feasibly completed the trip.
