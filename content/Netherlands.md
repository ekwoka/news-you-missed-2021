Officials in the Netherlands unveiled a plan to reduce the country’s livestock by about 1/3 over the next 13 years.

But it’s for a different reason: there’s too much poop.

The country has more than 100 million cattle, chickens, and pigs, the highest density in Europe, and can’t quite contain their waste without polluting important waterways.

Farmers, naturally, are pushing back, even though the multi-billion dollar plan intends to pay them to essentially exit the industry.
