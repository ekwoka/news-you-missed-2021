Portugal’s parliament pushed into the future of labor when it passed progressive measures to protect its increasingly online workforce.

In response to the shift to working from home, new laws bar employers from contacting employees during off-hours, allow parents of children under eight to work from home without bosses’ approval, and require employers to pitch in on employees’ electricity costs.

The move comes in response to the pandemic, but also as an effort to protect Portugal’s reputation as an attractive place for digital nomads to set up shop.
