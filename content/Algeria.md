Over on the northwest tip of Africa, an ongoing conflict between Algeria and Morocco might leave Spain in the cold.

Spain gets about half of its gas from Algeria, which pumps it through a pipeline in Morocco.

Morocco depends on Algeria for about 10% of its gas, and Algeria suspended this pipeline to both countries to upset Morocco in an ongoing territorial dispute.

It turns out, this may affect Spainiards the most who will still be able to get gas through alternate routes but at much higher prices.
