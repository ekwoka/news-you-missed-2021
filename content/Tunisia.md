There is also some speculation that Tunisian president Kais Saied’s appointment of a female prime minister may have been a way to calm critics who say he’s overreaching his power in the Arab Spring’s only remaining democracy.

Before Najla Bouden Ramadhane’s appointment, Saied had already suspended parliament, seized power, and fired the previous prime minister, and because Ramadhane doesn’t have a lot of political experience, her trajectory could be challenging.

But, she is already making history as the first female prime minister in the Arab world.
