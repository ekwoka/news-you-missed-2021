In the very same year that Barbados ended symbolic ties with the Queen of England and became a republic, the nation’s most famous export, Rihanna, became a national hero.

Well, technically the artist, entrepreneur, and proud bajan has been a national icon in the country for more than a decade, but this year her legendary status became official when the new republic’s prime minister designated her a national hero.

Already an ambassador for the Caribbean country, and recently named the world’s richest female musician, it seems that Rihanna’s reign just won’t let up–and Barbados is all the better for it.
