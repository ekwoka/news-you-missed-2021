The violence that’s gripped Ethiopia for the past year has done no favors for East African neighbors either––see the tiny coastal nation of Djibouti.

In July, protestors responding to a state-led attack blocked the rail line that connects the landlocked Ethiopia to the ocean.

Djibouti’s port, through which a whopping 90% of all Ethiopian goods pass, is the country’s key economic driver, and while the rail line’s closure wasn’t permanent, instability in Ethiopia has hampered the reliant Djibouti economy to the tune of an estimated $1.7 billion dollars in lost commerce.
