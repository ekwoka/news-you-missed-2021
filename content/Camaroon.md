Charges were laid against two transgender women who were simply having dinner in Cameroon when they were arrested for alleged homosexuality.

Later, they were sentenced to five years in jail, which some say is a death sentence in the male-dominated prison system.

The arrests and high-profile nature of the case, as one of the women is an activist for trans rights, exemplifies the anti-LGBTQ sentiments and laws that are still common in African countries, with at least 30 of them criminalizing homosexuality.
