For more than 35 years, Eswatini’s King Mswati III has ruled as absolute monarch and flaunted a lavish, luxurious lifestyle.

The problem? Sixty percent of the country’s 1.1 million residents live in poverty and they’re over his opulence.

For months, residents have participated in pro-democracy protests that have left scores dead and many more wounded.

Neighboring African countries, including South Africa, upon which Eswatini heavily relies, are stepping in to help navigate the movement, which many say won’t be going away until there’s a brighter future for this developing nation.
