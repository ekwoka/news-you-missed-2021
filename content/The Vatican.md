The Vatican's most famous resident donated 15,000 ice-creams to local prisoners during an unpleasant hot snap in a summer that set heat records across the Italian peninsula.

While the gesture was admittedly minor, it signaled the Vatican's dedication to aid the local population down on its luck.

The Vatican's charity office has also provided free testing and vaccines during the pandemic and has taken locals experiencing homelessness out for pizza.
