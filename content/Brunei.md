The people of Brunei are hoping for more sage decision-making from the new CEO of the nationâ€™s largest financial institution, Bank Islam Brunei Darussalam.

Hjh Noriani will be the first female CEO of the bank that manages $10 billion of assets and has expanded across Southeast Asia and into the Middle East in recent years.

After naming three women to top positions in 2019, the move follows an empowering trend at the bank in the traditionally conservative country.
