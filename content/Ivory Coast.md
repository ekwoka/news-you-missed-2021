In the Ivory Coast, stamping out illegal cocoa grow operations has proved next to impossible.

But that could change with the adoption of the most recent European Commission plan to curb global deforestation.

If implemented, this plan would require companies importing cocoa products into the EU to provide GPS data on the product's origin to ensure it wasnâ€™t illegally harvested.

For the Ivory Coast, spreading the responsibility of halting illegal cocoa production will help protect the meager 15% of its biodiverse forest still standing.
