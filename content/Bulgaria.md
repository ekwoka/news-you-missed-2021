International collaboration was the context that informed an embarrassing development in Bulgaria.

Led by the US Army, the NATO military exercise called Swift Response brought together 7,000 paratroopers from 10 member nations for some joint practice.

Swift Response, though, quickly became seriously regrettable when American soldiers accidently left the training zone and barged into and cleared out a Bulgarian sunflower oil factory.

The factory has since filed a lawsuit, while the US embassy, for its part, has apologized for the mistake.
