More than doubling the age of most of her competitors, a 46-year-old gymnast representing Uzbekistan took her final bow at the Olympics in Tokyo this summer.

It was Oksana Chusovitinaâ€™s eighth Olympics; she won the silver medal for vault in 2008, and capped off with 11 medals won at 17 world championships.

Up next? Spending more time with her Olympic wrestling husband and her son, who at 22, is older than most Olympic gymnasts.
