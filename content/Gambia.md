As part of their seemingly odd and certainly confusing court case agaisnt Myanmar, The Gambia won an important ruling this year.

On behalf of the Rohingya, a Muslim ethnic group persecuted in Myanmar, the tiny Gambia, with the backing of the Orgnization of Islamic Cooperation, a group of 57 nation-states, filed a lawsuit against Myanmar in 2019.

In September of this year, a judge ordered Facebook to disclose acocunts records pertaiining to the persecution in Myanmar, a big win for The Gambia, as it's widely understood that social media played a key role in the 2017 genocide.
