Cristiano Ronaldo couldn’t wait to get home after a controversial call in Serbia cost him and his country important World Cup qualifying points.

However, throwing his captain’s armband down in disgust as he exited the pitch unintentionally did a world of good for a six-month-old Serbian boy with spinal muscular atrophy.

Donated to a charity group who then auctioned off the armband, Ronaldo’s frustration resulted in a $71,000 haul, money which went directly to the six-month-old’s treatment.
