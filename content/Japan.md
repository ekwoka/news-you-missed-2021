Tensions are rising between Japan and the tandem of China and Russia.

While they’ve been escalating for years because of Beijing’s increased presence on islands controlled by Japan but claimed by Russia, they hit a new high when a 10-ship Chinese-Russian flotilla circumnavigated Japan’s main island this summer.

China and Russia say it was merely a diplomatic exercise, but Japan is worried a threatening presence means it will need to increase defense spending and be more on guard.
