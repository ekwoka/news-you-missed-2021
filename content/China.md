Birthrates in the world’s most populous country hit an all-time low since the country began tabulating the figure in 1978.

Infamous for its “one child” policy, China has been easing restrictions on family-size since 2015 as dropping birth rates began to worry state officials.

This year’s low water mark, though, hints that the problem may be beyond policy and expected demographic shifts as the country develops, and more so a function of rising cost of living and financial insecurity pushing potential parents to hold off.
