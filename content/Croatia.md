Prošek and Prosecco are two different types of wine with two different names.

Just how different the names are though, has Croatia and Italy at loggerheads.

Croatia has sought to trademark the name of their Prošek with the European Commission under the assumption that consumers would be able to differentiate it from Italian Prosecco.

Italian wine aficionados think differently and are fighting the move on account of potential confusion.

Italians also see the effort as an attack on Italian products more broadly, as Prosecco is a denomination of controlled origin–a wine that only comes from a specific region.
