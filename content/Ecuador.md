In Ecuador’s most famous islands, Darwin’s Arch died of natural causes.

Just a kilometer, or 0.6 miles, off the coast of Darwin Island in the Galapagos, the arch was a popular destination for divers and photographers.

Ecuadorian officials said that the bridge was brought down by natural erosion.

Year by year, though, erosion is becoming more of a threat and less natural, as volatile weather and warming waters are intensifying the process that created many of the earth’s arches in the first place.
