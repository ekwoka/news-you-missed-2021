2021 saw both the suspension and reinstatement of the Chadian Football Association by the hands of FIFA.

Citing government interference in Chad's effort to seize the Association's authority and training grounds, an unsurprising overstep under the ruling military council, soccer's ruling body banned the country from international tournaments.

While restrictions were ultimately lifted, Chad was disqualified from the all-important 2021 Africa Cup of Nations.
