A scarecrow of the seas may help to save the lives of thousands of seabirds each year thanks to researchers in Estonia who helped develop a buoy with googly eyes.

The device floats above small-scale fishing operation gill nets, which can be lethal to diving seabirds, and deters them from coming near.

In fact, scientists found it reduced the congregating birds by about a quarter who are turned off by eye contact and erratic buoy behavior.
