Kenya is known as a wildlife wonderland, but just how many creatures crawl there was an unknown number until the country completed its first wildlife census this year.

Using planes, drones, helicopters, boats, and 4x4s, researchers tallied the populations of more than 30 species across nearly 60% of the country to establish a baseline for one of the worldâ€™s most unique ecological places.

Using estimates from the past, the numbers of elephants, some 36,280, seem to be going up, but black rhinos, just 897, have fallen to critically endangered levels.
