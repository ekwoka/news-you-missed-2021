Traditionally, the transfer of power is supposed to be peaceful and seamless.

In Samoa, it wasn’t.

Fiame Naomi Mata’afa finally became the country’s prime minister in July, following several months of constitutional crisis during which her predecessor, Tuilaepa Sailele Malielegaoi, refused to acknowledge her victory.

The former leader had led the country for more than two decades, and would not step down.

After a series of legal battles and appeals, Mata’afa finally assumed control and is making history doing it as Samoa’s first female prime minister.
