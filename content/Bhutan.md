China continues to expand its presence around the globe, and in Bhutan this hasn’t been subtle.

In the past year, satellite imagery shows that multiple new villages have sprung up in a 60-square-mile, or 150-square kilometer, Bhutanese area that’s been a disputed site before, when India and China went to head about road construction there a handful of years ago.

Because of aligned interests when it comes to Chinese overreach, India has supported Bhutan’s claims to the contested territory.
