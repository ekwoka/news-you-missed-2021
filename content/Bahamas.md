At the other end of the Caribbean, three Cubans survived 33 days on a barren Bahamian island before being rescued by the US Coast Guard.

After capsizing at sea, likely in an attempt to flee Cuba, the three washed up on one of the least-hospitable Bahamas, surviving on coconut water, conch shells, and rats.

After receiving brief medical attention in Florida, the resourceful survivors were handed over to US Immigration and Customs Enforcement.

This isnâ€™t the first time The Bahamas have found itself as the meeting point between Cuban defectors and the US, as a similar rescue took place a few islands over not months before this one.
